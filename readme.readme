## Android Architecture
**Question:** Can you explain the Android Architecture?
**Answer:** Android Architecture consists of five key components: Linux Kernel, Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), Android Runtime (ART), Libraries, Application Framework, and Applications.

## Activity vs Fragment
**Question:** What is the difference between an `Activity` and a `Fragment`?
**Answer:** Activity represents a single screen with a user interface, while Fragment is a modular part of an activity.

## Intent in Android
**Question:** What is `Intent` in Android?
**Answer:** Intent in Android is a messaging object used to request an action from another component.

## RecyclerView vs ListView
**Question:** How does the `RecyclerView` work, and why is it preferred over `ListView`?
**Answer:** `RecyclerView` is an advanced and flexible version of `ListView`. It is a container for displaying large datasets which can be scrolled very efficiently by maintaining a limited number of views.

## Activity Lifecycle
**Question:** Can you explain the lifecycle of an Android `Activity`?
**Answer:** An `Activity` goes through various states from its inception to termination, including `onCreate()`, `onStart()`, `onResume()`, `onPause()`, `onStop()`, `onDestroy()`, and `onRestart()`.

## EventBus in Android
**Question:** Explain EventBus and how it's used in Android?
**Answer:** EventBus is a publish/subscribe event bus optimized for Android. It simplifies communication between different parts of your application.

## Android Notification System
**Question:** Describe Android's Notification System.
**Answer:** Android’s Notification System allows apps to alert users about important events, both silently and intrusively, through the notification bar, lock screen, or a pop-up dialogue.

## ContentProvider Purpose
**Question:** What is the purpose of Android’s `ContentProvider`?
**Answer:** `ContentProvider` manages access to a central repository of data, allowing data sharing between different apps securely.

## AsyncTask Explanation
**Question:** Explain AsyncTask. What problems does it solve and what issues might it have?
**Answer:** `AsyncTask` facilitates performing background operations and publishing results on the UI thread. However, it might lead to memory leaks and doesn't handle configuration changes well.

## BroadcastReceiver Concept
**Question:** What is `BroadcastReceiver`?
**Answer:** `BroadcastReceiver` responds to system-wide broadcast announcements. Apps can also initiate broadcasts to let other apps know that required data has been downloaded and is available for them.

## Loaders in Android
**Question:** How do Loaders work in Android?
**Answer:** Loaders provide asynchronous loading of data in an activity or fragment, handle data configuration changes efficiently, and track the source for data changes.

## ViewModel Usage
**Question:** What is `ViewModel` in Android Architecture Components?
**Answer:** `ViewModel` is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a conscious way about the lifecycle. It allows data to survive configuration changes like screen rotations.

## Service vs IntentService
**Question:** What is the difference between a `Service` and an `IntentService`?
**Answer:** `Service` runs on the main thread and is used for long-running operations, while `IntentService`, a type of Service, runs on a separate worker thread and is used for tasks with a finite duration.

## Handler and Looper
**Question:** Explain the concept of `Handler` and `Looper` in Android.
**Answer:** `Handler` is used to schedule and process messages and runnable objects associated with a thread's message queue. `Looper` loops through the message queue in a thread, dispatching each message and handling it.

## Dependency Injection in Android
**Question:** What is Dependency Injection, and how is it implemented in Android?
**Answer:** Dependency Injection is a design pattern where an object's dependencies are injected by the system, promoting code modularity and testability.

## Purpose of Manifest File
**Question:** What is the purpose of the `Manifest` file in Android?
**Answer:** The `AndroidManifest.xml` declares the app's package name, components, permissions, and libraries.

## Data Binding in Android
**Question:** What is Data Binding in Android?
**Answer:** Data Binding is a library that allows you to bind UI components in your layout files directly to data sources in your app using a declarative format.

## ConstraintLayout vs RelativeLayout
**Question:** What is the difference between `ConstraintLayout` and `RelativeLayout`?
**Answer:** `ConstraintLayout` offers a flexible and powerful layout system while `RelativeLayout` positions views based on their relation to other views.

## Room Persistence Library
**Question:** Can you explain what is `Room` in Android, and how does it work?
**Answer:** Room is a persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite, simplifying database operations and ensuring best practices are followed.

## Kotlin Coroutines
**Question:** What are `Coroutines` in Kotlin, and how are they used in Android development?
**Answer:** Coroutines are a Kotlin feature that converts async callbacks for long-running tasks into sequential code, making the code more readable and understandable.
